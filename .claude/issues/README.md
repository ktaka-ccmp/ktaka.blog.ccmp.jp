## Directory Structure

```
.claude/issues/
├── open/           # Active issues
├── completed/      # Resolved issues
├── wontfix/        # Closed without implementation
├── deferred/       # Postponed issues
└── README.md       # This file
```

Issues are organized by status. When status changes, move the file to the appropriate directory.

## File Naming Convention

New issues use the timestamp-based format:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<short-slug>.md
```

Example: `20260210-1430-login-history-enhancement.md`

## Issue ID Format

New issues use a timestamp-based ID:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHMM
```

- `YYYYMMDD`: Creation date
- `HHMM`: Creation time (24h format)

Example: `20260210-1430`, `20260210-1545`

## Section Update Rules

| Section | Update Rule |
|---------|------------|
| Created | Written once at creation |
| Closed | Written once when issue is resolved or closed |
| Description | Freely updatable |
| Related Issues | Freely updatable |
| Approach | Freely updatable (always reflects current plan) |
| Related Files | Freely updatable |
| Implementation Tasks | Freely updatable |
| **Decision Log** | **Append-only -- never edit or delete existing entries** |
| Resolution | Written once when issue is resolved |

The **Decision Log** preserves the history of design decisions, approach changes, and
rejected alternatives. When updating other sections (especially Approach), always add
a corresponding Decision Log entry explaining what changed and why.

## Status Values

| Status | Directory | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `open` | `open/` | New or in-progress |
| `completed` | `completed/` | Resolved and committed |
| `wontfix` | `wontfix/` | Closed without implementation |
| `deferred` | `deferred/` | Postponed for later |

## Commands

- `/issue` - Create or update an issue
- `/backlog` - View all open issues
- `/snapshot` - Create a session snapshot (different from issues)

## Workflow

1. Create new issue in `open/` directory
2. **Update this README's "Current Issues" table** (increment count, add row)
3. Work on the issue
4. When resolved, update Resolution section and move to `completed/`
5. If postponed, move to `deferred/`

**Important**: Always update the README table when creating, completing, or moving issues.

## Difference from Sessions

- **Sessions** (`.claude/sessions/`): Work context snapshots for transferring between machines
- **Issues** (`.claude/issues/`): Task/bug tracking that persists across sessions
