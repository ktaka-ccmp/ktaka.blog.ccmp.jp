<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Third-party authentication has become ubiquitous in modern web
applications, allowing users to sign in using existing accounts from
major providers. While OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are the
standard protocols for implementing such authentication, Google offers
two distinct approaches - the standard OIDC implementation and Sign in
with Google - whose relationship is often misunderstood. The similarity
between Sign in with Google and OIDC’s implicit flow can be particularly
misleading. Though they share some characteristics, such as direct ID
token delivery, they are fundamentally different implementations with
distinct capabilities and limitations.</p>
<p>This confusion is understandable. Sign in with Google’s token
delivery mechanism resembles OIDC’s implicit flow
(response_type=id_token), leading developers to assume it’s simply a
wrapper around OIDC. However, this surface-level similarity masks
significant differences in protocol implementation, security models, and
available features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note on Documentation</strong>: Google’s own <a
href="https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview">documentation</a>
states that “Sign in with Google is based on OAuth 2.0”. However, the
same documentation describes it as a proprietary SDK that “aims to offer
an easier and more secure experience for developers than the standard
OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols”. This mixed messaging has
contributed to developer confusion. While Sign in with Google might be
inspired by OAuth 2.0 concepts, its actual implementation is a
proprietary protocol that diverges significantly from standard OAuth
2.0/OIDC flows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="technical-relationship">Technical Relationship</h1>
<p>The resemblance between Sign in with Google and OIDC is apparent when
examining OIDC’s implicit flow configuration:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>response_type=id_token
response_mode=query</code></pre>
<p>Both approaches deliver ID tokens directly to the frontend. However,
this architectural similarity obscures fundamental differences in
implementation, security considerations, and extensibility. While Sign
in with Google provides a streamlined, Google-specific authentication
solution, OIDC offers a comprehensive, standardized protocol with
multiple flows and security options.</p>

<h2 id="sign-in-with-google">Sign in with Google</h2>
<p>Sign in with Google provides a simplified implementation through its
Identity Services API:</p>

<p>The Google Sign in page (loaded either in a popup window or
redirected main window) receives an ID token from /gsi/issue endpoint
and then: In popup mode: passes it to the main window’s callback
function via gsi_client.js In redirect mode: posts it to the specified
login_uri</p>
<h2 id="standard-oidc">Standard OIDC</h2>
<p>OIDC provides multiple implementation options, accommodating
different security needs:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>// Implicit Flow (Similar to Sign in with Google)
/authorize?
response_type=id_token&amp;
response_mode=query&amp;
client_id=...&amp;
scope=openid profile&amp;
redirect_uri=...&amp;
nonce=...

// Code Flow (More secure alternative)
/authorize?
response_type=code&amp;
client_id=...&amp;
scope=openid profile&amp;
redirect_uri=...&amp;
state=...&amp;
nonce=...</code></pre>
<p>The client (on the web browser) can receive an ID token or
authorization code as parameters in the redirect URL.</p>
<h1 id="authentication-flows">Authentication Flows</h1>
<p>The flow differences reveal the architectural distinctions between
these approaches. Sign in with Google implements a flow similar to
OIDC’s implicit flow. However, OIDC also provides the code flow, which
offers enhanced security through backend token exchange.</p>

<p>Sign in with Google implements a straightforward flow focused on ID
token delivery. While this approach simplifies implementation, it comes
with security considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications typically need to establish sessions with their backend
servers, requiring the ID token to be transmitted from the frontend to
the backend</li>
<li>ID tokens contain sensitive user information and are meant for
authentication</li>
<li>ID tokens are not designed to be passed between different parties -
they should ideally only flow from the authentication provider to the
intended recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, authorization codes in OIDC’s code flow are specifically
designed for such transmission through the frontend.</p>

<p>The OIDC code flow demonstrates the protocol’s flexibility, offering
enhanced security through backend token exchange and supporting
additional features like refresh tokens.</p>
<h1 id="implementation-distinctions">Implementation Distinctions</h1>
<p>The divergence between these approaches manifests in several key
areas:</p>
<h2 id="protocol-implementation">Protocol Implementation</h2>
<p>Sign in with Google employs a proprietary implementation that, while
similar to OIDC’s implicit flow, uses custom mechanisms and focuses
solely on authentication. This specialization allows for a simpler
developer experience but limits flexibility and provider
portability.</p>
<p>Standard OIDC, conversely, implements a complete authentication and
authorization protocol. It supports multiple flows, token types, and
security models, enabling developers to choose the most appropriate
approach for their specific requirements.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p>The security models reflect different priorities. Sign in with Google
optimizes for simplicity, handling tokens in the frontend with a
predetermined security model. OIDC provides more options, including the
secure code flow that keeps sensitive tokens server-side and supports
various security configurations.</p>
<h2 id="feature-scope">Feature Scope</h2>
<p>Sign in with Google’s focused approach provides efficient
authentication but limits additional capabilities. OIDC’s comprehensive
protocol supports various authentication and authorization scenarios,
multiple token types, and standardized endpoints.</p>
<h1 id="choosing-the-right-approach">Choosing the Right Approach</h1>
<p>The selection between Sign in with Google and OIDC should be guided
by specific project requirements:</p>
<p>Sign in with Google excels in scenarios requiring quick
implementation of Google-specific authentication, particularly when
additional OAuth features aren’t needed. Its simplified approach can
accelerate development for straightforward authentication needs.</p>
<p>Standard OIDC becomes essential when projects require provider
flexibility, enhanced security options, or additional OAuth features.
Its standardized approach supports long-term maintainability and
compliance requirements, though at the cost of increased implementation
complexity.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While Sign in with Google shares surface similarities with OIDC’s
implicit flow, understanding their distinct implementations is crucial
for informed architectural decisions. The resemblance in token delivery
mechanisms can mask significant differences in protocol implementation,
security models, and available features.</p>
<p>Developers should consider carefully whether their projects benefit
more from Sign in with Google’s streamlined, focused approach or OIDC’s
comprehensive, standardized protocol. This decision impacts not only
initial implementation but also long-term maintenance, security posture,
and provider flexibility.</p>
<p>Remember: The similarity between Sign in with Google and OIDC’s
implicit flow can be misleading. While they share some characteristics,
they are different implementations with distinct capabilities and
limitations.</p>
